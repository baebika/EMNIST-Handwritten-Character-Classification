# EMNIST-Handwritten-Character-Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying handwritten characters using deep learning techniques. This project uses EMNIST dataset which extends the MNIST dataset to include letters and digits.

## Dataset
- Consists of handwritten digits and characters.
- Provided images are in rotated format, thus require preprocessing.

## Preprocessing Steps:
- Data scaling and normalization.
- Flipping and rotating images for correct orientation.
- Reshaping data to 4D arrays for compatibility of TensorFlow.
